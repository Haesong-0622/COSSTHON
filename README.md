##### RESPCAM 
------------------------
  Camera-based home care services for the prevention and management of respiratory diseases
  With the development of smart IoT and AI technologies, various detection sensors have been released, enabling accurate information acquisition. 
  However, they often feel uncomfortable because they have to install and manage numerous sensors to ensure precision. 
  To solve this problem, we propose a solution to manage a home environment customized to individual users using only cameras. 
  These tools only need to be prepared during the initial setup, so they can simplify the process while maintaining high accuracy.
